Perfect choice ✅ — the **Voice To-Do App** hits almost every element in their JD: voice agents, retrieval, structured DB querying, and quick fullstack shipping. Here’s a high-level outline:

---

## 🔹 Architecture Overview

**Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind)**

* Clean UI with:

  * “Add Task” → record voice → transcribed.
  * “My Tasks” → display tasks retrieved from DB.
  * “Ask AI” → voice query answered by agent.

**Backend (Python FastAPI or Next.js API routes)**

* Expose endpoints for:

  * `/add_task` → handles STT + DB insert.
  * `/list_tasks` → fetch tasks from Postgres.
  * `/ask` → routes query to agent (Claude/OpenAI).

**Infrastructure (Postgres)**

* `tasks` table with columns:

  * `id`, `description`, `priority`, `due_date`, `status`.
* Optional: store audio + transcript.

**AI Layer (Agents / MCP)**

* **STT**: Whisper (OpenAI API).
* **LLM Agent**: OpenAI/Claude →

  * Parse transcript into structured JSON (task, due\_date, priority).
  * Answer queries like *“What’s on my plate today?”* by generating SQL or by summarizing tasks.
* **TTS**: Play back AI responses in voice.

## 🔹 User Flow

1. **Voice Input → Task**

   * User says: *“Remind me to email Prof. Chen tomorrow morning.”*
   * STT → text.
   * LLM parses into: `{task: "email Prof. Chen", due: "2025-09-19 9:00am"}`.
   * Insert into Postgres.

2. **Task Retrieval**

   * UI fetches `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE due_date >= NOW() ORDER BY due_date`.
   * Display in a nice Tailwind list.

3. **AI Agent Queries**

   * User says: *“What are my top 3 priorities this week?”*
   * STT → text.
   * LLM queries DB (via MCP or a SQL generator).
   * Response returned as natural language + optional TTS voice output.

4. **Completion Flow**

   * User says: *“Mark my email to Prof. Chen as done.”*
   * STT → LLM → SQL `UPDATE tasks SET status='done' WHERE description LIKE ...`.
   * DB updated.

## 🔹 Stretch Goals (if you have extra time)

* Add **categories** (work, personal, etc.).
* Add **voice playback** of today’s tasks (using TTS).
* Simple **search box** → natural language → tasks query.
* Deploy to **Vercel (frontend)** + **Railway/Render (backend + DB)**.

---

## 🔹 Interview Spin

You don’t need this to be polished — just enough to demo:

* “Add Task” via voice (STT + DB insert).
* “List Tasks” UI showing tasks.
* “Ask AI” with a single prompt (e.g., *“What’s due today?”*).

Then you can say:

> “I wanted to get a feel for your stack, so I hacked together a simple voice to-do app. It takes spoken input, stores it in Postgres, and lets an agent query tasks. It’s scrappy, but it shows how I’d glue STT, LLM reasoning, and DB infra together with Next.js.”

That nails their **“fast 0→1 builder”** culture.

⚡Do you want me to sketch a **concrete MVP build plan (like 4–6 tasks to finish in one night)** so you know exactly what to implement first for a working demo?
